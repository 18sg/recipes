Bread Maker
===========

The following recipes are for a Morphy Richards 'FastBake' bread maker but may
well work with other makes and models. The recipes come from the manual
supplied with this machine.

The recipes given here cannot be scaled but generally include a 'medium' or
'large' sized version (with suitably scaled quantities given in the first few
columns). Units are (regrettably) antique... Additionally, 'cups' refer to the
American kind (8 floz).

Ingredients must be added to the pan in the order stated (working from top to
bottom).
