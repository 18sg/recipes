Cola Syrup
==========

A really nice, quite floral cola. Dilute with cold sparkling water like a cordial. Make sure all ingredients are food grade and all oils are pure. Kola nut extract is sold as a tincture. The caramel is commonly sold as brewer's caramel. The concentrate can be stored in a cool dark place for extended periods, as can syrup. Each batch of syrup is about 1.8l and makes about 14l cola. Concentrate makes about 90l total. You might want to open the door while mixing the oils. They're potent. Also, be careful handling ingredients. Some are irritants and others stain. Micro-pipettes make measuring much easier. Adapted slightly from this recipe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWaNiwcQK2M

## Flavour Emulsion

This step makes an emulsion out of the oils so they'll mix with the ingredients in later steps.

    7.5ml orange oil
    7.5ml lime oil
    2ml lemon oil
    0.8ml cassia oil
    1.5ml nutmeg oil
    0.5ml coriander oil
    0.4ml lavender oil
    0.5ml neroli oil
    20g gum arabic

    emulsion := add oil slowly and mix vigorously with whisk in drill or powered balloon whisk approx 20mins(
        mix in high-sided glass(
            gum arabic,
            40ml water
        ),
        mix in small glass(
            orange oil,
            lime oil,
            lemon oil,
            cassia oil,
            nutmeg oil,
            coriander oil,
            lavender oil,
            neroli oil,
        ))

## Concentrate

The concentrate mixes in the remaining flavourings/colouring but leaves out the sugar (and some water) so it takes up less space in storage.

    200ml double strength caramel colouring
    70ml citric acid
    22ml vanilla extract
    4ml kola extract

    concentrate = mix(
        emulsion,
        mix(
            mix acid into caramel(
                mix until clear(
                    citric acid,
                    100ml water
                ),
                double strength caramel colouring
            ),
            vanilla extract,
            kola extract
        ))

## Syrup

This step makes a batch of syrup for mixing with soda water, like a cordial.

    1.4kg sugar

    syrup = mix(
        32ml concentrate,
        cool to room temp(
            disolve gently(
                simmer(
                    800ml water
                ),
                sugar
            ),
        ),
    )
