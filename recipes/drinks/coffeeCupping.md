Coffee Cupping
==============

A method for preparing coffee for cupping. This recipe is for a cup/bowl approx 250ml and can be scaled linearly for other sizes. You would typically prepare multiple coffees at the same time to compare. You taste by slurping vigorously from a cupping/soup spoon to spread the coffee around your mouth. Taste at regular intervals until the coffee reaches room temp.
