First-order Type-II Dahl for 4
==============================

A Masoor Dahl (not that it makes it any clearer to me). Really good, but looks
like its going to be dreadful until the very last minute. When I found this
recipe it claimed it was for 8. I'm not sure for eight what but probably not
full sized people. Besides, what are you doing making dahl for if you can't eat
several kilorams of dahl in a sitting?

    380g red lentils
    1 large onion, diced
    1 tbsp oil
    2 tbsp curry paste
    1 tbsp curry powder
    1 tsp tumeric
    1 tsp cumin
    1 tsp chilli powder
    1 tsp salt
    1 tsp caster sugar
    1 clove garlic, minced
    1 tsp root ginger, minced
    400g passata
