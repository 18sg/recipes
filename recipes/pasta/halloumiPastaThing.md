Halloumi Pasta Thing for 4
==========================

Pasta with halloumi and tomatoes. The halloumi and tomatoes can be cooked while
the pasta is boiling, and the amount of oregano is really just "as much as you
dare". Add the pasta to the frying pan (not the other way around) to allow it
to absorb the oil.

    400g orzo pasta
    {1 block} halloumi, cubed
    20 cherry tomatoes, roughly chopped
    16 sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
    1.5tbsp dried oregano
    2tbsp olive oil

    season well(
        stir together in frying pan(
            fry for 3 minutes(
                fry until golden brown(halloumi, olive oil, dried oregano),
                sun-dried tomatoes,
                cherry tomatoes),
            drain(boil(orzo pasta))))
