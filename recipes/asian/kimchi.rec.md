Kimchi
======

Used in Korean, Chinese, and Japanese cooking. Spicy, garlicky, slightly funky, and full of flavour. Great on burgers. Needs a pickling (i.e. Kilner) jar big enough for the cabbage (2l should do).  This is a fermented food so keep an eye out for any mould. Make sure you 'burp' the jar each day to avoid messy explosions.
