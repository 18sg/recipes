Roasted Potatoes with Rosemary and Garlic for 2
===============================================

This recipe has always seemed to produce especially good roast potatoes for
Jonathan. It makes a fair quantity so the 'for {2}' here assumes you are
serious about wanting a lot of potatoes...

You can almost certainly omit the Rosemary and Garlic for a fairly robust
'every day' roast potato recipe -- but you really shouldn't! Likewise, you can
chop the potatoes smaller or larger to taste.

You can do all of the steps up to the potatoes going into the oven the day
before. Just cover and keep in the fridge.
