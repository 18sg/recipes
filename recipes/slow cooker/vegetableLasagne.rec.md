Slow cooker vegetable lasagne for 4
===================================

I'm not one for vegetable lasagne but this is actually really nice. Double,
quadruple or more the mozzarella for more mozzarella. Layer the components in
the slow cooker from bottom to top: half aubergine disks, half of lasagne
sheets, third of veg mixture, remaining aubergine, remaining pasta, remaining
veg mixture.

    1 tbsp oil
    2 onions, sliced
    2 cloves garlic, chopped
    2 large courgettes, diced
    1 red pepper, deseeded and roughly sliced
    1 yellow pepper, deseeded and roughly sliced
    400g chopped tomatoes
    2 tbsp tomato puree
    2 vegetable stock cubes, finely chopped
    1.5 tsp dried basil
    1 large aubergine, sliced into disks
    6 lasagne sheets

    scatter on top and leave 10 minutes to melt (
        cook on high for 2.5 - 3 hours (
            layer as in description(
                stir cover and cook for 5 mins (
                    fry for 5 min until softened (
