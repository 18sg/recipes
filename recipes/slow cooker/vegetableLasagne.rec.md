Slow cooker vegetable lasagne for 4
===================================

I'm not one for vegetable lasagne but this is actually really nice. Double,
quadruple or more the mozzarella for more mozzarella.

    1 tbsp oil
    2 onions, sliced
    2 cloves garlic, chopped
    2 large courgettes, diced
    1 red pepper, deseeded and roughly sliced
    1 yellow pepper, deseeded and roughly sliced
    400g chopped tomatoes
    2 tbsp tomato puree
    2 vegetable stock cubes, finely chopped
    1.5 tsp dried basil
    250g mozzarella, chopped
    
    sliced aubergine = 1 large aubergine, sliced into disks

    veg mixture = stir cover and cook for 5 mins (
        fry for 5 min until softened (
            onions,
            garlic,
            oil,
        ),
        large courgettes,
        red pepper,
        yellow pepper,
        chopped tomatoes,
        tomato puree,
        vegetable stock cubes,
        dried basil,
    )

    scatter on top and leave 10 minutes to melt (
        cook on high for 2.5 - 3 hours (
            "layer (bottom to top)"(
                1/2 of the sliced aubergine,
                3 lasagne sheets,
                1/3 of the veg mixture,
                remaining sliced aubergine,
                3 lasagne sheets,
                remaining veg mixture,
            ),
        ),
        mozzarella,
    )
