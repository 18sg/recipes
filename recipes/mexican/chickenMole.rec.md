Chicken Mole for 6
==================

Really fantastic dish thats full of flavour. In a similar family to chilli con carne, but a thing of its own. Anchos are large chillies found dried in the spices section of larger supermarkets. The chipotle paste can be replaced with {2tsp} of chipotle sauce if needed. Serve with rice with a little lime juice and coriander stirred through.

    2 ancho chillies
    2tbsp sunflower oil
    8 skinless bone-in chicken thighs
    2 onions
    2tsp ground cumin
    1.5tsp cinnamon
    3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
    50g raisins
    2tbsp smooth peanut butter
    2tbsp chipotle paste
    1can chopped tomatoes
    400ml water
    25g dark chocolate
    150ml soured cream

    chillies, chilli water = remove(
        soak 20mins(
            cover (
                ancho chillies,
                boiling water)))

    chilli paste = whizz in food processor(
        remove seeds and stalks(
            chillies),
        roughly chop(
            garlic),
        raisins)

    chicken, casserole dish = set aside chicken(
        brown in casserole dish(
            season(
                skinless bone-in chicken thighs),
        sunflower oil))

If the sauce starts to look too thick in the next section, add some of the chilli water.
