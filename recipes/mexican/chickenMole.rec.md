Chicken Mole for 6
==================

Really fantastic dish thats full of flavour. In a similar family to chilli con carne, but a thing of its own. Anchos are large chillies found dried in the spices section of larger supermarkets. The chipotle paste can be replaced with {2tsp} of chipotle sauce if needed. Serve with rice with a little lime juice and coriander stirred through.

    2 ancho chillies
    2tbsp sunflower oil
    8 skinless bone-in chicken thighs
    3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
    50g raisins

    chillies, chilli water = remove(
        soak 20mins(
            cover (
                ancho chillies,
                boiling water)))

    chicken, casserole dish = set aside chicken(
        brown in casserole dish(
            season(
                skinless bone-in chicken thighs),
        sunflower oil))

    chilli paste = whizz in food processor(
        remove seeds and stalks(
            chillies),
        roughly chop(
            garlic),
        raisins)

If the sauce starts to look too thick in the next section, add some of the chilli water.
