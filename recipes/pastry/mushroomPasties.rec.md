Mushroom, swede, potato, onion and rosemary pasties makes 8
===========================================================

Nice vegetarian pasties, have them with mash and gravy.

They can be cooked from frozen, just bake for 1 hour instead. Always freeze
them on baking parchment! You might think that they would come off a plastic
chopping board easily, but you'd be wrong.

Supposedly it should be 160C for a fan oven, but 180C works fine...

    500g mixed mushrooms
    500g strong flour
    250g unsalted butter
    200g swede
    400g potatoes
    1 onion
    {1 pinch} dried rosemary
    egg, beaten

    pastry := chill 1 hour(
        wrap in cling-film(
            make a dough(
                rub in(
                    strong flour,
                    pinch of salt,
                    unsalted butter),
                200ml cold water)))

    filling := mix(
        squeeze and drain to remove liquid(
            scrunch together and leave for 30 mins(
                chop or tear into bowl(mixed mushrooms), 15g sea salt)),
        chop into small pieces(
            swede,
            potatoes,
            onion),
        dried rosemary,
        black pepper)


    bake 180C for 40 minutes on a lined baking sheet(
        brush(
            {fold over and press edges together, crimping to seal}(
                brush exposed pastry(
                    pile on one side leaving 2.5cm gap(
                        roll into 20cm rounds(divide(pastry)),
                        divide(filling)),
                    egg)),
            egg))
